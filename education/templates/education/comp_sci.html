    <h5>The path for graduation as a computer scientist at UC Santa Cruz is based upon ~five different pillars: </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Mathematics</li>
      <li>Algorithms</li>
      <li>Data Structures</li>
      <li>Computer Systems</li>
      <li>Variety of Languages</li>


    </ul>

    <h1 class="text-center">Lower Division Courses</h1>

    <h5>Programming Basics</h5>
    <p>Students take a series of introductory courses covering c & java, data structures, and algorithms. I don't really remember too much about the assignments unfortunately, but here are a few things which still remember about back then</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a RPN in C</li>
      <li>Basic data structures in java & C: linked lists, stacks, queues</li>
      <li>Basic algorithms: Insertion, buble, merge, quick, binary</li>
      <li>Basic SSH to unix server</li>
    </ul>

    <p></p>
    <h5>Mathematics</h5>
    <p>Math courses develop students ability to understand computer algorithms, data structures, and systems/applications. I wound taking a long series of mathematics classes originally as a computer engineer where I completed four different calculus courses as well as other fundamental math courses such as linear algebra and statistics. While these courses provided necessary insights towards computer science comprehension, they also served as the backbone of many other classes such as physics, electrical circuits, and AI.</p>

    <p></p>
    <h5>Physics</h5>
    <p>I took a series of three engineering physics classes: mechanics, waves & opics, and electricity & magnetism (E&M). The E&M class was by far the most valuable for its obvious relation towards computers. It helped me ground the connection between computer architecture and 'the real world'. However, the studies in waves & optics was suprisingly helpful for my studies in cognitive science when discussing visual perception. </p>

    <h5>Computer Systems</h5>
    <p>The UCSC CS deparment requires students to complete a set of 'fundamental' computer system courses as well as a set of elective courses.</p>

    <p></p>
    <h5>Senior Design Project</h5>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">Every CS/EE student is required to complete a year long 'capstone' project in order to graduate. During this time, students work together in teams of 4-6 members with the support of corporate or factilty sponsorship. The first quarter is dedicated to learning software development practices such as the agile methodology, clean coding, and version control while the second and third quarter has students apply these principles based on the sponsor's project.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">My capstone project, visualizing climate change, was sponsored through the capstone course instructor, Richard Julig. I led a team of three other students as scrum master to develop the data visualizations featured on this <a href="https://climate-visuals.herokuapp.com/">website</a>.
