    <h1 class="text-center" >Senior Design Project</h1>

    <h5>What is the senior design project</h5>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">Every CS/EE student is required to complete a year long 'capstone' project in order to graduate. During this time, students work together in teams of 4-6 members with the support of corporate or factilty sponsorship. The first quarter is dedicated to learning software development practices such as the agile methodology, clean coding, and version control while the second and third quarter has students apply these principles based on the sponsor's project.</p>

    <h5>My project</h5>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">My capstone project, visualizing climate change, was sponsored through the capstone course instructor, Richard Julig. I led a team of three other students as scrum master to develop the data visualizations. While our focus was to develop and investigate unique data visualizations for education purposes, I felt we never really accomplished education aspect. That said, I believe we did succeed in creating valuable visualizations.</p>

    <h3>Agile methodology</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h5>Pros</h5>
        <ul class="fa-ul">

          <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-plus"></i> Adaptive to unforseen obstacles</li>
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li> We didn't realize what we were getting ourselves into when learning D3. We chronically underestimated the required hours to develop visualization components. Having the agile methodology allowed us backlog and adjust our goals as needed.</li>
          </ul>

          <p></p>
          <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-plus"></i>Valuable 'toolset'</li>
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Agile systems provide the tools needed to thrive: sprints plans/reviews, scrumboard, burn-up chart. These tools helped keep my team from completely falling apart by holding people accountable for their work.</li>
          </ul>

        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p></p>

        <h5>Cons</h5>
        <ul class="fa-ul">

          <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-times"></i>Backlogging yielded team laziness</li>
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Because it was so easy to backlog work, I believe my teammates started to get lazy and not do their work. They oftensed said tasks were 'harder than expected' and then backlog the work which didn't get completeted...</li>
          </ul>

          <p></p>
          <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-times"></i>Difficult to plan expected hours per task</li>
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scrum requires time estimates for task planning. However, because we were working with new technologies and had little support from our sponsor, it was difficult to know how long something would take. SCRUM planning + novel technologies was a mess.</li>
          </ul>

        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>


    <h3>Teamwork & Communication</h3>

    <h5>Slack communication</h5>
    <p>We used slack to communicate throughout our development. While it was a the technology itself did its job very well, I believe we failed to communicate regularly. The lack of communication started to slowly poison our team during the second quarter of development. It made people feel like others weren't doing work resulting in a feedback loop which slowed development significantl. I believe if there were more 'punishing' outcomes from failing to show up to meetings/completeting work, the development process would have gone much different.
