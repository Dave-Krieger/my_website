    <h3><center>A page dedicated to various data-wrangling scripts I wrote for my senior design project team, Visualized Climate Change</center></h3>
    <p>I wrote a handful of python parsing scripts for my team. I did this because some individualswere being 'blocked' from developing their visualizations because they couldn't get their data formatted right</p>
    <p>These files don't have very good programming practices because I was in a huge RUSH to complete them. I also knew that once they were completed, we would likely never go back to re-use them. You've been warned.</p>

    <h5>This wrangling script converts multiple .tsv files to a single .json file. The rendered visual from the formatted dataset can be viewed <a href="https://climate-visuals.herokuapp.com/energy/energy.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</h5>

    <!-- <p>This dataset was probably the hardest one I worked with. The raw input datafiles were 'dirty' tsv's split into twelve different categories. The output was a single .json file sorted by year -> country -> category : amount. It involved nested lists, string compares, and typecasting</p> -->

    <h3>Input</h3>
    <p>Twelve 'dirty' TSV files sorted by energy category. Two of which are very important, total energy consumption & total energy production, because they are used later to calculate net energy.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>Each file was a 'dirty' tsv because they contained weird characters and unneccessary strings at the top of each file. I removed these issues with a small script not shown.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-6"><p>Init and start section. I made use of a global var so I didn't have to keep passing it.</p>
        <p>The getyears() func generates a list of all the years: 1990-2018</p>
        <p>For each file within the system, read the file's data and store that the entire dictionary as list element in allList.</p>
        <p>Generate .json output file based on the data... we'll go more indepth in a bit.</p>

        <p>Navigate to directory and create file name strings</p>
        <p>split each line based on their delimiter: tab or '\t'</p>
        <p>The first token is the country string. If this country has never been read before, create a new country by passing it as a new element to the global list: countryList</p>
        <p>Check bounds based on year span. If safe, then add each year's value to a temp list.</p>
        <p>Once completed, store the templist as a nested list within another temporary list called: thisFileList. </p>
        <p>Continue going line by line adding each line's data as tuple data to thisFileList.</p>
        <p>Finally, iterate through all the files adding 'thisFileList' as an index to 'allList'</p>

    <h3 class="">writeToFile</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'data_viz/img/write_1.png' %} " alt="">
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>A few different obj's being passed:
        <ul>
          <li>outFileString: name of the output file</li>
          <li>yearList: list from 1990-2018</li>
          <li> countryList: list of every country that was read from the input files</li>
          <li>allList: list of each file's data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Create the output file along with the first header information.</p>
        <p>Our data is first organized by year. Hence we iterate through the years as saved in yearList</p>
        <p>Time for some nested loops based on the nested list data, all iterating and indexing based on year! This is why using a list/array was nice. Instead of having to bind data to each year, I carefully saved each datapoint into the correct index which why we iterate from range(1,29).</p>
        <p>For every country that was read, go through the allList searching for two specfic datasets: energy production & consumption. Once found, find the net sum and save that as totalVal</p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <p></p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'data_viz/img/write_2.png' %} " alt="">
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>Now write the data to the file in a .json format</p>
        <p>Write the country name and associated net energy amount. Create a newline and indent it. keep this indentation size while iterating through each file's data which is saved in allList.</p>
        <p>Write the corresponding energy type name and the associated data amount.</p>
        <p>After each file is read and the correct data is written, check to see if we have written data for every country for THIS YEAR ONLY. If not last country, add a ',' if it is the last, don't add a ','</p>
        <p>Some more formatting stuff checking the year and seeing if we need to add a ',' or not</p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <p></p>
    <h3 class="">Finished Product</h3>
    <p>So 19,000 lines later we reach the nested data section of energy consumption for 2018. Having nested data like this exponentially increases the file size compared to its original smaller .tsv form. However, certain applications may require a .json form such as this one. It's helpful because it enables other api's/parsers to easily interpret the data as a key:value pair with parent & child node relationships.</p>

    <h1>Final Words</h1>
    <p>This dataset was probably the hardest one I worked with. The requirements of tracking all the data, storing it, and iterating over it was not a trivial task (for me at least...). If you want to explore more of my parsing code, feel free to explore: <a href="https://github.com/Dave-Krieger/Krieger-Dave-Portfolio/tree/master/visualizing-climate-change/dataSets" target="_blank">here</a> The parsing files are usually called 'convert.py'.</p>
